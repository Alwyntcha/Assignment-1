            <p style="text-align: center;">"As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush begins in the past by examining scientists' research on science used in war.<br>
             Despite the essay written in 1945, it was not a vain story at all. Vannevar Bush 's wise insight was well incorporated,<br>
              so the growth of science that has been in history was admirable. At that time, Vannevar Bush had suggested scientists<br>
               the direction of future scientific development. A lot of information was pouring in, and scientists thought about how<br>
                to manage and use the information efficiently. After their thoughts about it, 'memex' resulted in. Through a machine<br>
                 called Memex, which has a very similar form to ‘World-Wide-Web’, we are able to share human memories and thoughts with<br>
                  each other.

            </div>

            <p style="text-align: center;">"Long Live The Web" by Time Berners-Lee has a similar context in that he considered the greatness of science,<br>
                 technology, and data. Web developers, businesses, governments, and citizens should openly understand and<br>
                  cooperate with each other as we have done so far to explore the basic etiquette of the Internet as well as<br>
                   a better environment and direction of development of the Internet. This leads to agreements not only in the<br>
                    simple Internet world, but also in science, technology, and society, leading to respect for human basic values.<br>
                     As the web already occupies a large part of our world and is helpful, we are also relying on it. As it was a<br>
                      tower that ancestors had been working hard on, it should be more agonized and improved.

           <p style="text-align: center;">Science has continued to develop, and accordingly, it has improved the quality of life in many ways, including<br>
             control over the material environment, solving food, clothing, and shelter, improving immunity from diseases,<br>
              and developing psychological science. Through this, we have created a secretary named ‘AI’ and are even trying<br>
               to enable interaction with them. Just as imagined a "memex" that melts the mechanisms that humans think of,<br>
                it is essential for developers to think deeply about the interaction between humans and technology. This is<br>
                 because it is the key to the development of science that humans can directly utilize the five senses.
